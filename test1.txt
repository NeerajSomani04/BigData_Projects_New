Couple of Questions:

1) In section "Queries to run", its mention that Comment_ID must match across all 3 dataset but looks like Comment_ID is not present in "Post_meta.zip" file data set. Hence, comment_ID is present in 2 data sets "comment_text" and "comment_info_jsonl". Is this understanding correct? I need to consider it only for these 2 data sets.

2) 


Below are commands used to perform some activity -->

Below command to create Hive database --> 
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS Viacom_Test; 

Drop table comment_text;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS comment_text (
message STRING,
h_id STRING)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE;

Load data local inpath '/home/dkothari/vi-com/BigData_Projects_New/comment_text' into table comment_text;

describe formatted comment_text; --> this command can be used to see the details of hive table.

Below is the hive data warehouse location for our database -->
hdfs://nn01.itversity.com:8020/apps/hive/warehouse/viacom_test.db/comment_text

hdfs dfs -put /home/dkothari/vi-com/BigData_Projects_New/post_meta/ vi-com/BigData_Project/post_meta

Below command is for post_meta parquet files --  COMPRESSED WITH SNAPPY

Drop table post_meta;

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS post_meta (post_h_id STRING, post_created_time TIMESTAMP, name_h_id STRING, type STRING) 
STORED AS PARQUET 
TBLPROPERTIES ('PARQUET.COMPRESS'='SNAPPY');

Load data local inpath '/home/dkothari/vi-com/BigData_Projects_New/post_meta' into table post_meta;

describe formatted post_meta;

Drop table comment_info_jsonl;

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS comment_info_jsonl (
text STRING)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hive.hcatalog.data.JsonSerDe';

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS comment_info_jsonl (
h_id STRING
, posts struct< 
data: array < struct <
comments: struct < 
data: array< struct < 
comment_count: INT
, comments: struct <

comment_count: INT

STORED AS TEXTFILE;

I downloaded jar from below path --
http://snowplow-hosted-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/third-party/rcongiu/json-serde-1.1.6-jar-with-dependencies.jar

add jar /home/dkothari/json-serde-1.1.6-jar-with-dependencies.jar; -- this command added the jar in hive consol.

-- this serde is working -- 'org.apache.hive.hcatalog.data.JsonSerDe'
we might need this serde -- org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe 

Load data local inpath '/home/dkothari/vi-com/BigData_Projects_New/comment_info_jsonl' into table comment_info_jsonl;

for cloudera -->
Load data local inpath '/home/cloudera/vi-com/BigData_Projects_New/comment_info_jsonl' into table comment_info_jsonl;


Below are queries:
1) this query is used to get count of posts :
select count(distinct post_h_id) from (select explode(posts.data.h_id) as post_h_id from comment_info_jsonl) as temp; -- 297 distinct
select count(distinct post_h_id) from post_meta; -- 3531 distinct

select count(distinct PM.post_h_id)
from (select explode(posts.data.h_id) as post_h_id from comment_info_jsonl) as CIJ 
INNER JOIN post_meta as PM
on CIJ.post_h_id = PM.post_h_id; -- 282 distinct 

Questions for Queries:

1) Which day had the highest number of top level comments (excluding replies)?
Solution:

--- Below SQL took 7 min on one node cluster ---

select to_date(temp1.comment_created_time) as comment_created_time, sum(temp1.comment_count) as total_comments
from 
(select CIE.*,
row_number() over (partition by comment_id order by comment_created_time desc, comment_like_count desc, comment_count desc) as row_num
from comment_info_exploded_new CIE 
INNER JOIN post_meta PM
on PM.post_h_id = CIE.post_id
INNER JOIN comment_text CT
ON CT.h_id = CIE.comment_id) 
as temp1
where temp1.row_num = 1
group by to_date(temp1.comment_created_time)
order by total_comments desc
limit 1;

Result :- Date: 2018-01-10 (10-Jan-2018) , Total comments: 610
------------------------

select to_date(temp1.comment_created_time) as comment_created_time, sum(temp1.comment_count) as total_comments
from 
(select CIE.*,

ON CT.h_id = CIE.comment_id) 
as temp1
where temp1.row_num = 1
group by to_date(temp1.comment_created_time)
order by total_comments desc
limit 1;

Result :- Date: 2018-01-10 (10-Jan-2018) , Total comments: 600

----------
select to_date(temp1.comment_created_time) as comment_created_time, sum(temp1.comment_count) as total_comments
from 
(select CIE.*,

order by total_comments desc
limit 1;

Result :- Date: 2018-01-10 (10-Jan-2018) , Total comments: 600

---------------------------
if I consider count of comment_id as per below SQL:

select to_date(temp1.comment_created_time) as comment_created_time, count(distinct temp1.comment_id) as total_comments
from 
(select CIE.*,
row_number() over (partition by comment_id order by comment_created_time desc, comment_like_count desc, comment_count desc) as row_num
from comment_info_exploded_with_replies CIE 
INNER JOIN post_meta PM
on PM.post_h_id = CIE.post_id
INNER JOIN comment_text CT
ON CT.h_id = CIE.comment_id) 
as temp1
where temp1.row_num = 1
group by to_date(temp1.comment_created_time)
order by total_comments desc
limit 1;

Result :- Date: 2018-01-10 (10-Jan-2018) , Total comments: 321

---------------------------------
if I consider reply_id as well for comparision with comment_text dataset :

select to_date(temp1.comment_created_time) as comment_created_time, count(distinct temp1.comment_id) as total_comments
from 
(select CIE.*,
row_number() over (partition by comment_id order by comment_created_time desc, comment_like_count desc, comment_count desc) as row_num
from comment_info_exploded_with_replies CIE 
INNER JOIN post_meta PM
on PM.post_h_id = CIE.post_id
INNER JOIN comment_text CT_top
ON CT_top.h_id = CIE.comment_id 
INNER JOIN comment_text CT_reply
ON CT_reply.h_id = CIE.reply_id) 
as temp1
where temp1.row_num = 1
group by to_date(temp1.comment_created_time)
order by total_comments desc
limit 1;

Result :- Date: 2018-01-10 (10-Jan-2018) , Total comments: 312

for question 2)

count distinct comment_id 
sum comment_like_count
reply_date and top_level_comment_date should be greater than 2018-01-10
group by post_type

group by temp1.post_type;


---------------

for question 3) 
select page names, page ids, avg_length

get distinct post_id, comment_id and reply_id from comment_exploded table
join comment_id and reply_id with comment_text table to get "message" field for each "ID"s
calculate length of each message
calculate avg = sum(length of each message) / count (messages)
group by page_id
order by avg desc
limit 5

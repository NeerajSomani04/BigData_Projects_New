Couple of Questions:

1) In section "Queries to run", its mention that Comment_ID must match across all 3 dataset but looks like Comment_ID is not present in "Post_meta.zip" file data set. Hence, comment_ID is present in 2 data sets "comment_text" and "comment_info_jsonl". Is this understanding correct? I need to consider it only for these 2 data sets.

2) 


Below are commands used to perform some activity -->

Below command to create Hive database --> 
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS Viacom_Test; 

Drop table comment_text;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS comment_text (
message STRING,
h_id STRING)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE;

Load data local inpath '/home/dkothari/vi-com/BigData_Projects_New/comment_text' into table comment_text;

describe formatted comment_text; --> this command can be used to see the details of hive table.

Below is the hive dataware house location for our database -->
hdfs://nn01.itversity.com:8020/apps/hive/warehouse/viacom_test.db/comment_text

hdfs dfs -put /home/dkothari/vi-com/BigData_Projects_New/post_meta/ vi-com/BigData_Project/post_meta

Below command is for post_meta parquet files --  COMPRESSED WITH SNAPPY

Drop table post_meta;

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS post_meta (post_h_id STRING, post_created_time TIMESTAMP, name_h_id STRING, type STRING) 
STORED AS PARQUET 
TBLPROPERTIES ('PARQUET.COMPRESS'='SNAPPY');

Load data local inpath '/home/dkothari/vi-com/BigData_Projects_New/post_meta' into table post_meta;

describe formatted post_meta;

Drop table comment_info_jsonl;

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS comment_info_jsonl (
text STRING)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hive.hcatalog.data.JsonSerDe';

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS comment_info_jsonl (
h_id STRING
, posts struct< 
data: array < struct <
comments: struct < 
data: array< struct < 
comment_count: INT
, comments: struct < 
data: array < struct < 
comment_count: INT
, created_time: STRING
, h_id: STRING
, parent: struct < 
h_id: STRING
>
, up_likes: INT
> > >
, created_time: STRING
, h_id: STRING
, up_likes: INT 
> > >
, h_id: STRING 
> > >
)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hive.hcatalog.data.JsonSerDe'
STORED AS TEXTFILE;

I downloaded jar from below path --
http://snowplow-hosted-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/third-party/rcongiu/json-serde-1.1.6-jar-with-dependencies.jar

add jar /home/dkothari/json-serde-1.1.6-jar-with-dependencies.jar; -- this command added the jar in hive consol.

-- this serde is working -- 'org.apache.hive.hcatalog.data.JsonSerDe'
we might need this serde -- org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe 

Load data local inpath '/home/dkothari/vi-com/BigData_Projects_New/comment_info_jsonl' into table comment_info_jsonl;

for cloudera -->
Load data local inpath '/home/cloudera/vi-com/BigData_Projects_New/comment_info_jsonl' into table comment_info_jsonl;


Below are queries:
1) this query is used to get count of posts :
select count(distinct post_h_id) from (select explode(posts.data.h_id) as post_h_id from comment_info_jsonl) as temp; -- 297 distinct
select count(distinct post_h_id) from post_meta; -- 3531 distinct

select count(distinct PM.post_h_id)
from (select explode(posts.data.h_id) as post_h_id from comment_info_jsonl) as CIJ 
INNER JOIN post_meta as PM
on CIJ.post_h_id = PM.post_h_id; -- 282 distinct 

Questions for Queries:

1) Which day had the highest number of top level comments (excluding replies)?
Solution:
select 
sum(comment_count) as total_comment_count
group by created_time of top level comments
order by total_comment_count desc 
limit 1;
